# loading-bar
Loading bar in css and a bit of JS

### to-do :
[ ] add a scroll-back up arrow corner right
[ ] that's it ?

### Smart alternative :

- Once saw a blog with logo getting filled ; must be possible if the div is filled like my progression bar, but with transparency and the z-index superior to that of the filled bar.
- On the side or at the bottom.
- If on the side, make sure it is not mistakable for the scrolling bar.

Add a slider ?
