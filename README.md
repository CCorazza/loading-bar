# loading-bar
Responsive loading bar in css and a bit of JS

### to-do :
- [ ] add a scroll-back up arrow corner right
- [ ] Maybe find a way to get rid of jQuery that's so big for so small a project ?
- [ ] that's it ?

### Smart alternative :

- Once saw a blog with logo getting filled ; must be possible if the div is filled like my progression bar, but with transparency and the z-index superior to that of the filled bar.
- On the side or at the bottom.
- If on the side, make sure it is not mistakable for the scrolling bar.

Add a slider ?
